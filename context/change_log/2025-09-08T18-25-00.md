# Change Log â€” CwI demo fixes

## Fix: CwI demo clipping and vertical wrapping

- Stage: mark overlay container with class `stage` so plugin can measure stage height for 5%/3%/12% scaling.
  - File: src/core/Stage.ts
- Renderer: reverted visibility-time relayout that caused shrink-to-fit issues; restored stable update flow.
  - File: src/core/Renderer.ts
- DomMount: make `effectsRoot` in-flow (`position: relative`) to let host size to content and prevent 0px width.
  - File: src/runtime/DomMount.ts
- CwI plugin: keep wrapping but limit width to ~95% of stage width in px; padding scaled with stage height.
  - File: demo/plugin-server/plugins/cwi@1.0.0/index.mjs
- Added `.stage` class add/remove on bind/unbind; removes on dispose to avoid leaks.
  - File: src/core/Stage.ts

Validation
- pnpm typecheck/build: pass.
- Manual demo: expect no right/bottom clipping; no vertical per-letter stacking; loud/whisper/pop preserved.

Notes
- If single-line only is required, prefer auto scale-down strategy in plugin (optional follow-up).
