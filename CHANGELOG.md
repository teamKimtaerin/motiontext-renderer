## 1.2.1

### Patch Changes

- fix: demo plugin preview now reads timeOffset from manifest.json

  Demo plugin previews now use timeOffset values from manifest.json files instead of hardcoded ['0%', '100%']. Default fallback is now ['0%', '0%'] to match updated calculation base.
  - Updated generatePreviewScenario and generateLoopedScenario functions
  - Added timeOffset field to PluginManifest interface
  - Changed default timeOffset from ['0%', '100%'] to ['0%', '0%']
