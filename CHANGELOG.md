# motiontext-renderer

## 1.4.0

### Minor Changes

- Add clear() method for explicit scenario cleanup
  - Add `clear()` method to MotionTextRenderer public API for removing current scenario while keeping renderer alive
  - Add `clear()` method to RendererV2 internal API for comprehensive cleanup
  - Enables explicit scenario removal without requiring a new scenario load
  - Maintains renderer instance for reuse after clearing
  - Provides alternative to `dispose()` which terminates the entire renderer

## 1.3.1

### Patch Changes

- Fix style inheritance priority to respect node-specific styles over track defaults
  - Fixed mergeStyles() and mergeBoxStyles() functions to prioritize node-specific styles over track defaults
  - Node-specific styles now correctly override track defaultStyle/defaultBoxStyle
  - Resolves issue where group nodes' individual styles were ignored in favor of track defaults
  - Maintains backward compatibility with existing scenarios

  Fixes: Style inheritance priority not respecting the intended hierarchy in v2.0 scenarios

## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- a027c4c: feat: implement track-based boxStyle inheritance system
  - Split Style interface into TextStyle and BoxStyle for better separation of concerns
  - Add defaultBoxStyle to Track type for group node styling defaults
  - Implement boxStyle inheritance only for group nodes (text nodes inherit text styles only)
  - Add backward compatibility for legacy combined styles with automatic splitting
  - Update RendererV2 to use separate text and box style application functions
  - Add comprehensive test suite for boxStyle inheritance scenarios
  - Create demo sample showcasing boxStyle inheritance across multiple cues

  This enables track-level box styling management where group nodes inherit box styles from their track while text nodes only inherit text styles, allowing for consistent container styling with individual group customization when needed.

## 1.2.2

### Patch Changes

- fix: relative time offset calculation for plugin end boundaries
  - Fixed percentage-based time offset calculation when applied to end boundaries
  - Negative percentages on end boundaries now correctly shorten the window from the end
  - Example: base [2,4] with '-20%' offset now correctly calculates to 3.6 instead of wrong value
  - Added comprehensive test cases for edge cases in time offset calculations

## 1.2.1

### Patch Changes

- fix: demo plugin preview now reads timeOffset from manifest.json

  Demo plugin previews now use timeOffset values from manifest.json files instead of hardcoded ['0%', '100%']. Default fallback is now ['0%', '0%'] to match updated calculation base.
  - Updated generatePreviewScenario and generateLoopedScenario functions
  - Added timeOffset field to PluginManifest interface
  - Changed default timeOffset from ['0%', '100%'] to ['0%', '0%']
